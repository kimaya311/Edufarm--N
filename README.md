Boiler plate for p5.play

In the game,firstly I have allowed the player to choose the season of crop and the crop and then they are to guide their seeds through the maze to the correct position i.e. where there is suitable(fertile)soil and sufficient sunshine.........this is till where i have designed the prototype but originally i will do a second level as well where you grow the plant by efficiently watering it and removing weeds,lastly i also want to include a quick quiz to see their process (it will be short and sweet!)........through this project i wanna get the kids to know how great farming can be and learn the most simplest of fundamentals.
The main reason behind this project is that I felt uncomfortable now knowing that as a kid I thought farming was for conservative rural people and not of importance but as I mature I understand that farming is a lifestyle people can choose for themselves and it is a field where AI technology and modern tech can help,as much as food seems secondary to some people I feel it is vital for them to understand that this is an important part of our existence.
